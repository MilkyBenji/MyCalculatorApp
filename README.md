### Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Perform simple calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and responsive design with a visually appealing layout.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The buttons highlight when clicked, providing immediate visual feedback to users.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed to work on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** The main programming language.
- **PyQt6:** A toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.

## Motivation and Purpose

The inspiration behind **MyCalculatorApp** stems from the desire to explore the potential of Python's PyQt6 framework while creating a tool that is both practical and educational. The goal is to build a calculator that:

- **Demonstrates GUI development:** Showcases how to design and implement a responsive desktop application using PyQt6.
- **Provides a learning resource:** Offers beginners a hands-on example of how event handling, layout management, and dynamic styling work in a real-world project.
- **Solves a common problem:** Delivers a straightforward, user-friendly interface for everyday arithmetic operations without unnecessary complexity

## Problem Statement and Objectives

Many existing calculators either oversimplify basic operations or become overwhelmingly complex with additional functions. **MyCalculatorApp** aims to address this issue by focusing on:

- **Simplicity:** A clean, minimal interface that is accessible to users of all levels.
- **Essential Functionality:** Implementing core arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Educational Value:** Serving as an exemplary project for those looking to learn PyQt6 and GUI programming in Python.
- **User Interaction:** Enhancing the experience with immediate visual feedback (such as temporary button style changes) to make interactions intuitive

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
- **PyQt6:** The application is built with PyQt6. Install it using pip.
- **Logo Image:** Place a `logo.png` file in the project directory to display the appâ€™s logo.
